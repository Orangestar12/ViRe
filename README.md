### ViRe is an open-source VR mocap studio built in Unity

<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
ViRe can be used for anyone who wants to record motion, but cannot afford a huge and expensive motion capture studio. <br />
All you need is a simple VR Setup. ViRe runs on top of OpenXR, an asset to support all kinds of VR Headsets. <br /><br />

A video has been made to showcase and explain ViRe. Simply click on the YouTube logo to watch it.

### ViRe definitely runs with the following headsets <br />

<br /> <br /> <br /> 
It very well may run with other headsets as well, but I don't want to guarantee it. It is free, so just try it out if you like. <br />

### ViRe is currently in the Alpha
It supports the tracking of the headset and both hand controllers. We are working on getting additional Trackers to be supported, and for every place you do not have a tracker, procedual bone movement will help out.
